# userharvest
This is code that harvests user names from a txt file that contains email address


# Use Case:

The use case for this code was to take a mailing list/group of emails out of MS Outlook, allow you to pull the user names out of the email address, and place them into a csv/txt file. At which point you can later take this list, and feed it into another operation.

The original operation that this output was used for was populating 'Users' into JIRA Service Desk from a organization, that was defined in MS Outlook.
It's a hacky way to get these user names, but it was the best option.
